Unlike the next one this does not work in Opera because Opera believes that this is the old HTTP Basic Auth phishing attack, which it is not.  It's simply a malformed URL.  If you click okay on the dialogue it will work, but as a result of the erroneous dialogue box I am saying that this is not supported in Opera."
